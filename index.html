        <h3>Project: Web app Development & Deployment </h3>
        <p>My most recent project, was a group endeavour where myself and my Four of my fellow peers had embarked on building 
        a food review site which specialised in filtering nearby takeaways in and around the hertfordshire region. We concluded our trade 
        in applications such as wordpress and had the sole intention of using languages such as Javascript, HTML and CSS. </p>

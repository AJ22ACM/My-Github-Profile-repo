      One of the most fulfilling aspects of my university experience has been supporting my peers. I take great pride in helping others overcome their academic challenges, which inspired me to become a student body representative. This role allows me to contribute positively to our learning community, fostering collaboration and growth.

    <p>
      Outside of academics, I’m passionate about staying active. Running and playing football are not just hobbies for me — they’re a source of energy, focus, and balance in my life. These activities teach me discipline and teamwork, qualities I carry into all areas of my personal and professional development.
